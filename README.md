# challenge-2-portfolio

## Description
- Purpose is to make a portfolio and give an employee a good idea of my past projects and give good examples of what kinds of code I have some familiarity with.
- The goal is to create a responsive layout that uses all of the elements that we have used in the past module, using flexbox, and adapting links using hover, visited, etc.
- This project was created so I can get more comfortable using different div tags, and creating links within images. Making sure those links scroll to the correct locations within the page.
- This allows the user to be able to navigate the page to go to where they need to go, and being able to go different projects by clicking the images and going to their corresponding project pages.
- I learned how much you can do by creating a responsive page, and how easy it can make to navigate different projects.
